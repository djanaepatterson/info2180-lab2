     <h2>An Inspired Heart </h2>

     <p>Despite the adversities, Im inspired by the people, by the earth and by my own ambitions
     Truth is, we are all living in a time we never saw coming,yet we continue to push. The sun continues to shine
     and the people continue to rise. Ive seen numerous business being formed, relationships being mended 
     new babies being welocmed to the earth and an insurmounable to trees and flowers bloom.
     That is inspiring. We are in a pandemic, a time of uncertanitie and great sadness but we are still header
     overcoming the odds. I believe in myself and my potientials more than ever now. Like th wings of the butterfly,
      my heart flutters and like the people, my soul is empowered.
     </p><br></br>
     <p> The hope that we all continue to have, is something worth being proud of, the very fact that  you still see 
         see it necessary to get stuff done is admirable and commendable. It brings me pure joy and motivation. There is so much 
         bad that is bring highlighted in the world but nobody ever seems to highlight the resilence of the people and the strength
         of nature. My cherry tree blossom more than 15 different times this summer, despite the rain and heavy winds and all that jazz, it stud tall and 
         provided. Everyday I looked at it in awe, as we picked the current bundle and waiting just a few short days for the next to arrrive.
         I mean, if a cherry can be that determined, we have no excuse, right. And for those who have a hard time adjusting, just go outside and admirable
         nature, I promise you its the most motivational aspect of light.

        <h2>Listen.</h2>

        <p>In order to listen, you must be silent, that is exactly why the two words share the exact same letters. Why do you need to listen?
        Well, whenever you are receiving instructions about something you have no idea how to do, what do you do? You listen. Life is unpredictable
        and most times we dont know what to do. We ask an insurmountable amount of question throughout our lifetime and inorder to get a satisfying
         answer, we must first listen. The world is full with many amazing teachers but can they all speak on your particular situation? No, that impossible.
         As only you know and only you understand whats happening in your own little world. They may provide important and helpful instruction and advice. 
         But how do you apply it? You must first LISTEN, not only to the instructor but to your own self. Get a room, put away all disrtactions, create a silent place
         and listen. Whenever, there is a new task, change or stage in your life and you have no idea what to do. Just Listen. </p>
